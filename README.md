## Introduction

This repo implements the procedure presented in the original paper of the RCNN [here](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2014/papers/Girshick_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_2014_CVPR_paper.pdf), by using Pytorch as DL framework. \
We try here to reproduce the result in this paper and provide a library usable for detection tasks.\
If you are interested in the original implementation of this paper, follow this [link](https://github.com/rbgirshick/rcnn).

## Dependencies
